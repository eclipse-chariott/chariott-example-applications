**PR COMMIT MESSAGE**

Use Conventional Commits to describe the PR commit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0

<type>[optional scope]: </description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to
the consumers of your library:

- `fix:` a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates
with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- `feat:` a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this
correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a !
after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR
in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example `build:`, `chore:`
, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a
convention similar to git trailer format.
