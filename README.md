# Eclipse Chariott Incubator - Example Vehicle Applications

- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Examples](#examples)
  - [Dog mode](#dog-mode)

## Introduction

This repository contains Eclipse Chariott example applications and integrations with other
components like [Eclipse Agemo](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/Agemo),
[Eclipse Ibeji](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/ibeji), and
[Eclipse Freyja](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/freyja). It also serves as a place to incubate
early ideas for an eventual blueprint.

## Examples

### Dog mode

The [dog mode](./dogmode/README.md) allows a car owner to keep their dog safe while they are away
from the car. If the ambient temperature is high, multiple different applications will interact
with each other to ensure that the temperature inside the car is at a safe level for the dog. This
example currently uses Eclipse Chariott and is in design and development to integrate with other
Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle projects.
