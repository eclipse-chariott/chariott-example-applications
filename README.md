## Eclipse Chariott Incubator - Example Vehicle Applications
This repository contains chariott example applications and integrations with other components (like Eclipse Agemo, Eclipse Ibeji, and Eclipse Freyja). It also serves as a place to incubate early ideas for an eventual blueprint.

### Dog mode
The dog mode allows a car owner to keep their dog safe while they are away from the car. If the
ambient temperature is high, multiple different applications will interact with each other to ensure that
the temperature inside the car is at a safe level for the dog. This example currently uses Eclipse Chariott and is in design
and development to integrate with other Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle projects.
